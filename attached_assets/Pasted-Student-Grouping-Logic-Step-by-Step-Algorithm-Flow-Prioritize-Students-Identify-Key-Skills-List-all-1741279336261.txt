Student Grouping Logic
Step-by-Step Algorithm Flow
Prioritize Students
Identify Key Skills: List all students with skills rated 4 or 5 in key areas (e.g., Business Planning, Presentation) and queue them for initial placement.
Sequential Placement: Prioritize students with higher skill levels to ensure strong competencies in each group. Place students rated 3 or below afterward to balance team abilities.
Group Assignment
For each student, attempt to assign them to a group based on the following constraints:
Group Capacity: Ensure the group has not reached its maximum size.
Gender Balance: Maintain an even distribution of males and females.
NUIN Uniqueness: Ensure no two students with the same NUIN end up in the same group.
Ethnic Diversity: Promote a mix of ethnicities by avoiding repetition that undermines diversity.
Backtracking
If a student cannot join any group without violating constraints, move to the next group for placement.
If all groups conflict, reassign the student to the first group with a conflict, overriding constraints only as a last resort.
Finalize Groups
After assigning each student, review and adjust to ensure that all constraints are met as closely as possible.

Why This Solution?
Skill-Based Prioritization
Strong Foundations: Students with top-rated skills are assigned first, ensuring that each group has key expertise.
Balanced Teams: Lower-rated students are allocated afterward, reducing skill disparity within teams.
Diversity & Inclusion Checks
NUIN Diversity: No group contains duplicate NUINs, encouraging unique perspectives.
Ethnic Representation: Groups include a mix of ethnicities to foster collaboration and cultural exchange.
Gender Balance: Each group has a fair representation of males and females.
Smart Backtracking
Guaranteed Placement: Ensures all students are assigned by reevaluating placements when constraints are violated.
Adaptive Flexibility: Reassignments are made strategically to maintain balance and meet constraints.
Group Size Management
Capacity Control: Groups adhere to size limits, preventing overcrowding.
Uniform Distribution: Ensures consistent workloads across groups for fairness.
